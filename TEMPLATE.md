# Template

This repository is meant to be copied: a new project starts from it with
identity, RBAC, sessions, email, audit log, rate limiting and diagnostics
already in place, and grows its own modules next to `products`.

## Start a new project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raulaguila/authenticity.git my-app
cd my-app/backend
make rename MODULE=github.com/acme/my_app NAME=my_app
make init
```

`make rename` rewrites the Go module path and the name `authenticity` in every
tracked file: imports, Docker images and containers, the database roles
`<name>_app` and `<name>_mailer`, the pg_cron jobs and titles. `NAME` must be
lowercase letters, digits and `_`, since it becomes Postgres role names. Then
point the `origin` remote at the new repository and drop the `products`
example once a real module replaces it. Backend paths below are relative to
`backend/`. The frontend follows (`cd ../frontend && make init`): the visible name
lives in `frontend/src/lib/brand.ts` and the mark in `frontend/src/components/brand-mark.tsx`.

## Add a module

`products` is the reference. `make module NAME=invoice` (in `backend/`, with
`PLURAL=` when the plural is not the name plus "s") copies it into a new module:
migration, domain, ports, use case, repository, handler, tests and web screens,
with the wiring lines added next to the products ones and the Swagger spec
regenerated. Then replace the copied fields (name, price, enabled) with the
module's own and review the pt-BR texts. The table below is what it touches,
for a module written by hand. The architecture test (`tests/architecture`) fails
if the core imports an adapter, GORM, Fiber or the config.

| Step | File (products) | What goes there |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1. Schema | `deploy/db/migrations/000004_products.*.sql` | Table in schema `app`, indexes, `updated_at` trigger, and the RBAC resource row in `usr.usr_resource`. Add a new numbered pair; never edit a released one. |
| 2. Resource | `internal/core/domain/action.go` | Constant with the resource code, equal to the row in `usr.usr_resource`. |
| 3. Domain | `internal/core/domain/product.go` | Entity, filter and patch types. No tags, no imports from adapters. |
| 4. Ports | `internal/core/port/input/product.go`, `internal/core/port/output/product.go` | The service the handler calls and the repository the service needs. |
| 5. Use case | `internal/core/usecase/product/service.go` | Validation and rules. Errors are `apperror` codes. Administrative changes call `policy.Audit` inside the transaction. |
| 6. Repository | `internal/adapter/outbound/persistence/postgres/product/repository.go` | SQL with GORM; wrap errors with `shared.WrapError`. |
| 7. Handler | `internal/adapter/inbound/http/rest/handler/product/handler.go` | Routes with `middleware.Require(authz, resource, action)`, request and response types, `swag` annotations. |
| 8. Wiring | `internal/core/port/input/application.go`, `internal/composition/wire.go`, `internal/adapter/inbound/http/rest/server.go` | Field in `Application`, construction, and the route group behind `bearer`. |
| 9. Tests | `service_test.go`, `handler_test.go`, `tests/integration/product_test.go` | Unit tests for rules and HTTP mapping; integration tests against Postgres. |
| 10. Docs | `make swagger` | Regenerates the Swagger spec from the annotations. |
| 11. Web types | `frontend/src/lib/api/types.ts`, `frontend/src/lib/api/endpoints.ts` | Response types and one function per route. |
| 12. Web screen | `frontend/src/app/(app)/products/page.tsx`, `frontend/src/lib/navigation.ts`, `frontend/src/lib/i18n/messages.ts` | The page, a menu entry gated by `needs: [resource, action]`, and the texts in both languages. |

The app role gets read and write rights on new tables in `usr`, `sys` and
`app` by default privileges. A table in a new schema needs its own `GRANT`.

What a module gets from the products pattern:

- **Edit conflicts.** Each row has a `version`; an update that sends the version
  it read is refused with 409 (`CONFLICT`) when someone saved in between, and
  the screen asks to discard and redo instead of overwriting.
- **Background jobs.** `policy.EnqueueJob(ctx, uow, kind, payload)` inside the
  use case's transaction queues a job in `sys.job`; the module's handlers
  (`product.Jobs`) are registered in `composition.NewJobs`, and every backend
  instance runs the worker. Failed runs retry with backoff up to `max_attempts`;
  `policy.PermanentJobError` stops at once. Handlers must be safe to repeat.
- **Files.** `output.FileStore` keeps uploads on disk (`STORAGE_DRIVER=local`,
  one instance) or in an S3-compatible bucket (`s3`: AWS S3, MinIO, R2). The
  profile picture (`/v1/me/avatar`) is the example. Request bodies are capped at
  about 100 KB for every route; larger uploads need their own listener or a
  streamed body.

A request already carries its correlation id and actor in the context
(`pkg/reqctx`), so logs, outbox messages and audit entries of a new module pick
them up with nothing to wire.

## What a copy inherits

- Hexagonal layout with an import check, and the `shortcut:` comments that name known limits (`grep -rn "shortcut:"`).
- Migrations that run up and down, `authenticity_app` and `authenticity_mailer` roles without owner rights.
- `X-Request-ID` correlation, administrative audit log, rate limits shared by every instance.
- Private diagnostics server with `/metrics` and `/health`.
- A Next.js frontend with the session in an httpOnly cookie, light and dark themes, pt-BR and en-US.
